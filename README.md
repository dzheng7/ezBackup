# ezBackup
GUI and command line based backup utilities

These folders are two different Visual Studios projects, which both are intended to backup the user's files. 

ezBackup backs up files using a User Interface, while ezBackupAuto does it automatically on a schedule.

While running the ezBackup program only requires running the .exe file, ezBackupAuto is more specialized; instructions on how to run the program can be found in the TestKit folder.
